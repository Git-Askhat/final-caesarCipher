Caesar Cipher Algorithm

The Caesar Cipher algorithm is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

For example

With a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. We are required to write a JavaScript function that takes in a string to be encrypted as the first argument and a shift amount as the second argument.

The shift amount can be a positive or negative integer (a positive shift signifies a shift to right whereas negative to left).
